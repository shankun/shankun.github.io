Introduction {#intro}
------------

I’ve been a huge fan of coroutines since the mid-1990s.

I encountered the idea as a student, when I first read The Art of Computer Programming. I’d been programming already for most of my childhood, and I was completely blown away by the idea, which was entirely new to me. In fact, it’s probably not an exaggeration to say that in the whole of TAOCP that was the single thing that changed my life the most.

Within a few months of encountering the idea for the first time, I found myself wanting to use it in real code, during a vacation job at a (now defunct) tech company. Sadly I was coding in C at the time, which didn’t support coroutines. But I didn’t let that stop me: I came up with a C preprocessor trick that worked well enough to fake them, and did it anyway.

The trick I came up with has limitations, but it’s reliable enough to use in serious code. I wrote it up a few years later in the article ‘[Coroutines in C](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html)’, and I’ve been using it ever since, in both C and C++, whenever the code I’m trying to write looks as if it would be most naturally expressed in that style.

Or rather, I do that in code bases _where I can get away with it_, because it’s unquestionably a weird and unorthodox style of C by normal standards, and not everyone is prepared to take it in their stride. Mostly I limit my use of C-preprocessor coroutines to free software projects where I’m the lead or only developer (in particular, [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) and [`spigot`](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/spigot/)), because there, I get to choose what’s an acceptable coding style and what’s not. The only time I’ve ever used the same technique in code I wrote for an employer was in that original vacation job where I invented the trick – and I’m sure I only got away with it that time because my team didn’t practise code review.

Of course, I’m also happy to use coroutine-style idioms in any language where you _don’t_ have to resort to trickery, such as using generators in Python whenever it seems like a good idea.

Whenever I _can’t_ use coroutines, I feel limited, because it’s become second nature to me to spot parts of a program that _want_ to be written in coroutine style, and would be more awkward to express in other ways. So I’m very much in favour of coroutines becoming more mainstream – and I’ve been pleased to see support appearing in more and more languages over the decades. At the time of writing this, Wikipedia has an [impressive list of languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine#Native_support) that now include coroutine support; from my own perspective, the big ones are Python generators, and the addition of a coroutine system to C++20.

I recently got round to [learning about the C++20 system](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/coroutines-c++20/) in detail. In the course of that, I had conversations about coroutines with several friends and colleagues, which made me think more seriously about the fact that I’m so fond of them, and wonder if I had anything more specific to say about that than ‘they’re really useful’.

It turned out that I did. So this article presents my ‘philosophy of coroutines’: _why_ I find them so useful, what kinds of thing they’re useful for, tricks I’ve learned for getting the most out of them, and even a few different ways of thinking _about_ them.

But it discusses coroutines as a general concept, not specific to their implementation in any particular language. So where I present code snippets, they’ll be in whatever language is convenient to the example, or even in pure pseudocode.

Why I’m so enthusiastic about coroutines {#awesome}
----------------------------------------

Go on then, why _do_ I like coroutines so much?

Well, from first principles, there are two possibilities. Either it’s because they really are awesome, or it’s because they suit my personal taste. (Or a combination of the two, of course.)

I can think of arguments for both of those positions, but I don’t think I have the self-awareness to decide which is more significant. So I’ll just present both sets of arguments, and let you make up your own mind about whether you end up also thinking they’re awesome.

### The objective view: what makes them useful? {#objective}

To answer ‘what makes coroutines useful?’, it’s useful to start by deciding what we’re _comparing_ them to. I can’t answer ‘why is a coroutine more useful than _X?_’ without knowing what _X_ we’re talking about. And there’s more than one choice.

#### Versus explicit state machines {#vs-state-machines}

Two decades ago, when I wrote ‘[Coroutines in C](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html)’, I included an explanation of why coroutines are useful, based on the idea that the alternative was to write an ordinary function containing an explicit state machine.

Suppose you have a function that consumes a stream of values, and due to the structure of the rest of your program, it has to receive each individual value via a separate function call:

```
function process_next_value(v) {
    // ...
}
```

And suppose the nature of the stream is such that the way you handle each input value depends on what the previous values were. I’ll show an example similar to the previous article, which is a simple run-length decompressor processing a stream of input bytes: the idea is that most input bytes are emitted literally to the output, but one byte value is special, and is followed by a (length, output byte) pair indicating that the output byte should be repeated a number of times.

To write that as a conventional function accepting a single byte on each call, you have to keep a state variable of some kind to remind you of what you were going to use the next byte for:

```
function process_next_byte(byte) {
    if (state == TOP_LEVEL) {
        if (byte != ESCAPE_BYTE) {
            // emit the byte literally and stay in the same state
            output(byte);
        } else {
            // go into a state where we expect to see a run length next
            state = EXPECT_RUN_LENGTH;
        }
    } else if (state == EXPECT_RUN_LENGTH) {
        // store the length
        run_length = byte;
        // go into a state where we expect the byte to be repeatedly output
        state = EXPECT_OUTPUT;
    } else if (state == EXPECT_OUTPUT) {
        // output this byte the right number of times
        for i in (1,...,run_length)
            output(byte);
        // and go back to the top-level state for the next input byte
        state = TOP_LEVEL;
    }
}
```

(This is pseudocode, so I’m not showing the details of how you arrange for `state` and `run_length` to be preserved between calls to the function. Whatever’s convenient in your language. These days they’re probably member variables of a class, in most languages.)

This is pretty unwieldy code to write, because structurally, it looks a lot like a collection of blocks of code connected by ‘goto’ statements. They’re not _literally_ goto statements – each one works by setting `state` to some value and returning from the function – but they have the same semantic effect, of stating by name which part of the function is going to be run next.

The more complicated the control structure is, the more cumbersome it becomes to write code in this style, or to read it. Suppose I wanted to enhance my run-length compression format so that it could efficiently represent repetitions of a _sequence_ of bytes, not just `AAAAAAA` but `ABABABAB` or `ABCDEABCDE`? Then I wouldn’t just need an _output_ loop to emit _n_ copies of something; I’d also need a loop on the input side, because the input format would probably contain an ‘input sequence length’ byte followed by that many bytes of literal input. But I can’t write that one as a `for` statement, because it has to return to the caller to get each input byte; instead, I’d have to build a ‘for loop’ structure out of these small building blocks.

The more code you write in this style, the more you probably wish that the caller and callee were the other way round. If you were writing the same run-length decompression code in a context where you _called_ a function to read the next byte, it would look a lot more natural (not to mention shorter), because you could call the get-byte function in multiple places:

```
function run_length_decompress(stream) {
    while (byte = stream.getbyte()) {
        if (byte != ESCAPE_BYTE) {
            output(byte);
        } else {
            run_length = stream.getbyte();
            byte_to_repeat = stream.getbyte();
            for i in (1,...,run_length)
                output(byte_to_repeat);
        }
    }
}
```

This function actually contains the same state machine as the previous version – but it’s entirely implicit. If you want to know what each piece of code will do when its next input byte arrives (say, during debugging), then in the state-machine version you answer it by asking for the value of `state` – but in this version, you’d answer it by looking at a stack backtrace to find out which of the calls to `stream.getbyte()` the byte will be returned from, because that’s what controls where execution will resume from.

In other words, each of the three state values `TOP_LEVEL`, `EXPECT_RUN_LENGTH` and `EXPECT_OUTPUT` in the state-machine code corresponds precisely to one of the three calls to `stream.getbyte()` in this version. So there’s still a piece of data in the program tracking which of those ‘states’ we’re in – but it’s the _program counter_, and doesn’t need to be a named variable with a set of explicit named or numbered state values.

And if you needed to extend _this_ version of the code so that it could read a list of input bytes to repeat, it would be no trouble at all, because there’s nothing to stop you putting a call to `stream.getbyte()` in a loop:

```
            num_output_repetitions = stream.getbyte();
            num_input_bytes = stream.getbyte();
            for i in (1,...,num_input_bytes)
                input_bytes.append(stream.getbyte());
            for i in (1,...,num_output_repetitions)
                for byte in input_bytes
                    output(byte);

```

and you wouldn’t have to mess around with inventing extra values in your state enumeration, coming up with names for them, checking the names weren’t already used, renaming other states if their names had become ambiguous, carefully writing transitions to and from existing states, etc. You can just casually write a loop, and the programming language takes care of the rest.

(I tend to think of the state-machine style as ‘turning the function inside out’, in a more or less literal sense: the calls to a ‘get byte’ function ought to be nested deeply _inside_ the code’s control flow, but instead, we’re forced to make them the _outermost_ layer, so that ‘now wait for another byte’ consists of control falling off the end of the function, and ‘ok, we’ve got one now, carry on’ is at the top.)

Using coroutines, you can write the code in this latter style, with the explicit state machine replaced by the implicit program counter, _even_ if the rest of the program needs to work by passing each output byte to a function call.

In other words, you can write this part of the program ‘the way it wants to be written’ – the way that is most convenient for the nature of what the code has to do. And you didn’t have to force the _rest_ of the program to change its structure to compensate. That might have required equally awkward contortions elsewhere, in which case you’d only have moved the awkwardness around, and not removed it completely.

Coroutines give you greater freedom to choose the structure of each part of your program, independently of the other parts. So each part can be as clear as possible.

_Coroutines mean never having to turn your code inside out._

#### Versus conventional threads {#vs-threads}

In the 1990s and early 2000s, that was the only argument I felt I needed in favour of coroutines. But now it’s 2023, and coroutines have another competitor: multithreading.

Another way to solve the code-structure dilemma in the previous section would be to put the decompression code into its own thread. You’d have to set up a thread-safe method of giving it its input values – say, some kind of lock-protected queue or ring buffer, which would cause the decompressor thread to block if the queue was empty, and the thread providing the data to block if it was full. But then there would be no reason to _pretend_ either side was making a function call when it really wasn’t. Each side _really would_ be making a function call to provide an output byte or read an input byte, and there would be no contradiction, because the call stacks of the two threads are completely independent.

One of my software projects, [`spigot`](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/spigot/), is a complicated C++ program completely full of coroutines that generate streams of data. I was chatting to a friend recently about the possibility – in principle – of rewriting it in Rust. But I don’t actually know a lot about Rust yet (if I did try this, it would be a learning experience and a half!), and so of course I asked: ‘What about all the coroutines? Would I implement those using async Rust in some way, or what?’

My Rust-programmer friend replied: no, don’t even bother. Just use threads. Turn each of `spigot`’s coroutines into ordinary non-async Rust code, and run it in its own thread, passing its output values to some other thread which will block until a value is available. _It’ll be fine. Threads are cheap._

I have to start by acknowledging my personal biases: my _first_ reaction to that attitude is purely emotional. It just gives me the heebie-jeebies.

My own programming style has always been single-threaded wherever possible. I mostly only use extra threads when I really can’t avoid it, usually because some operating system or library API makes it impossible, or _astonishingly_ awkward, to do a thing any other way.<sup id='footnote-win32-read-write'>1</sup> 
I’ve occasionally gone as far as parallelising a large number of completely independent computations using some convenient ready-made system like Python `multiprocessing`, but I’m at least as likely to do that kind of thing by putting each computation into a completely separate _process_, and parallelising them at the process level, using a `make`\-type tool or GNU `parallel`.

Partly, that’s because I still think of threads as heavyweight. On Linux, they consume a process id, and those have a limited supply. Switching between threads requires a lot more saving and restoring of registers than an ordinary function call, and _also_ needs a transfer from user mode to kernel mode and back, with an extra set of saves and restores for that. The data structures you use to transfer data values between the threads must be protected by a locking mechanism, which costs extra time and faff. _Perhaps_ all of these considerations are minor in 2023, where they were significant in 2000? I still _feel_ as if I wouldn’t want to commit to casually making 250 threads in the course of a single `spigot` computation (which is about the number of coroutines it constructs in the course of computing a few hundred digits of [$e^π−π$](https://xkcd.com/217/)), _or_ to doing a kernel-level thread switch for every single time one of those threads passes a tuple of four integers to another. `spigot` is slow enough as it is – and one of my future ambitions for it is to be able to parallelise 1000 of _those_ computations! But I have to admit that I haven’t actually tried this strategy and benchmarked it. So _maybe_ I have an outdated idea of what it would cost.

Also, I think of threads as _dangerous_. You have to do all that locking and synchronisation to prevent race conditions, and it’s often complicated, and easy to get wrong. My instinct is to view any non-trivial use of threads as 100 data-race bugs waiting to happen. (And if you manage to avoid all of those, probably half a dozen deadlocks hiding behind them!) Now in this _particular_ conversation we were talking about Rust, and that’s a special case on this count, because Rust’s unique selling point is to guarantee that your program is free of data races by the time you’ve managed to get it to compile at all. But in more or less any other language I think I’m still right to be scared!

So I have strong prejudices against ‘just use real threads, it’ll be fine’. But I accept that I _might_ be wrong about those. Supposing I am, are there any other arguments for using coroutines instead?

One nice feature of everything being in the same system thread is debuggability. If you’re using an interactive debugger, you don’t have to worry about which thread you’re debugging, or which thread a breakpoint applies to: if the whole overall computation is happening in the same thread then you can just place a breakpoint in the normal way and it will be hit.

And if you prefer debugging via ‘recompile with print statements’, that’s _also_ more convenient in a single-threaded setup where the transfers of control are explicit, because you don’t have to worry about adding extra locks to ensure the debug messages themselves are atomic when multiple threads are producing them. You might not mind having to do fiddly lock-administration when you’re setting up the _real_ data flow of your program, but it definitely slows down investigation if you have to do it for every throwaway print statement!

But another nice thing about coroutines is that they’re easy to _abandon_. If a thread is in the middle of blocking on a lock, and you suddenly discover you no longer need that thread (and, perhaps, not the one it was blocking on either, or 25 surrounding threads), then depending on your language’s threading system, it can get very painful to arrange to interrupt all those threads and terminate them. Even if you manage it at all, will all the resources they were holding get cleaned up? (File descriptors closed, memory freed, etc.)

I don’t think thread systems are generally great at this. But coroutines _are_: a suspended coroutine normally has an identity as some kind of actual object in your programming language, and if you destroy or delete or free it, then you can normally arrange for it to be cleaned up in a precise manner, freeing any resources.

Using `spigot` as an example again: most of its coroutines run indefinitely, and are prepared to yield an infinite stream of data if you want them to. At some point the ultimate consumer of the whole computation decides it’s got enough output, and destroys the entire web of connected coroutines. Using C++ with preprocessor-based coroutines, this is reliably achieved with zero memory leaks. I’d hate to have to figure out how to terminate 250 actual system threads as cleanly.

Also, having a language object identifying the coroutine instance can be used for other stunt purposes. I’ll talk more about that in [a later section](#named-object).

So _I_ still prefer coroutines to threads. But I have to acknowledge that my reasons are a little bit more borderline than the reasons in the previous section.

(However, this discussion is all about _pre-emptive_ threads. _Cooperative_ threads which yield to each other explicitly are a different matter, and I’ll talk about those [later](#cothreads) as well.)

### The subjective view: why do _I_ like them so much? {#subjective}

This is already the kind of essay where I acknowledge my own bias. So I should also admit the possibility that it’s not so much that coroutines are objectively amazing, but rather, that they appealed especially strongly to _me personally_ for some reason that doesn’t apply to everybody.

I have a couple of theories about what that reason might be, if there is one.

#### “Teach the student when the student is ready” {#student-ready}

One possibility is that the concept was presented to me at exactly the right stage in my education.

I’d already been programming for a number of years when I read TAOCP, so I’d already felt for myself the frustration of having to write a piece of code ‘inside out’ – that is, in the form of an explicit state machine that I’d rather have avoided – and I hadn’t thought of any way to make that less annoying. So when Donald Knuth helpfully presented me with one, I pounced on it with gratitude.

But if I’d encountered the idea of coroutines earlier, _before_ I’d felt that frustration, then I might not have appreciated it as much. It would have been one among many concepts that went through my brain as I read the books, and I’d have thought, ‘ok, fine, I expect that’s useful for _something_’, and then I’d have forgotten it (along with half of the rest of TAOCP, because there’s a _lot_ of stuff in there!). And perhaps I might not have managed to recall it later, when the problem did appear in my life.

Conversely, the idea of coroutines might _also_ have had less impact on me if I’d learned about it _later_. I have a strong suspicion that if I’d spent another (say) five years writing pieces of code inside out because I had no idea there was another option, I’d have got much _better_ at writing code inside out, and much more used to it, and then the opportunity to avoid having to do it wouldn’t have seemed like such a huge boon any more.

Also, by that time, I’d probably have thought of some actual advantages to the inside-out state-machine style of coding, and started making use of them. There are often silver linings to be found in situations like this. In this case I can’t say for sure what they might be (since I never _did_ become that practised at the skill); but one possibility that springs to mind is that an explicit list of states might make exhaustive testing more convenient (you can ensure you’ve tested every state and every transition). But whatever the compensating advantage might be, once I’d noticed it, I’d have been reluctant to lose it for the sake of (as I would have seen it) not _that_ much extra convenience.

(This is probably related to Paul Graham’s idea of the [Blub Paradox](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html), in which you look at a less powerful language than your favourite one and you _know_ it’s less powerful, because it lacks some feature you’re used to, and you can’t imagine how you’d get anything done without that. But you look at a more powerful language that has features yours doesn’t, and whatever they are, you seem to have been getting along fine without them – so you conclude that they can’t be _that_ important, and that the ‘more powerful’ language isn’t that much better really.)

So perhaps it’s just that coroutines hit me at precisely my moment of peak frustration with exactly the problem they solve, and that’s why I adopted them with so much enthusiasm.

#### They suit my particular idea of code clarity {#clarity}

When you look at an existing piece of code, there are two different ways you might want to understand it.

One way is: _on its own terms, what does this code do, and how do I modify it to do it differently?_ For example, in the [decompressor example](#vs-state-machines) a few sections ago, suppose you wanted to look at the code and figure out what the compressed data format was – either to write a specification, or to check it against an existing specification. Or suppose someone had just _changed_ the specification for the compressed data format, and you had to adjust the code for the new spec.

For that purpose, it doesn’t really matter how the code fits into the rest of the program. In fact you don’t even need to _see_ the rest of the program. You could figure out the format from _either_ of the code snippets I showed (the one with a state machine, or the one that calls `stream.getbyte()`), and it wouldn’t matter at all that the rest of the program hasn’t even been written. In both cases, you can see that the code is getting a stream of bytes from _somewhere_, be it a caller or a subroutine; you can follow the logic through and see what bytes cause what effects; if you’re updating the code, you just have to follow the existing idioms for input and output.

But although you _can_ do that level of work on either version of the code, it’s much easier to do it on the version that calls a ‘get byte’ function. At least, I think so; if anyone actually finds the state machine version _easier_ to work with in that kind of way, I’d be interested to know why!

But the other way you might want to understand a piece of code is: _how does this fit into the rest of the program, and how can I change that?_ If you had no interest at all in the compressed data format and no reason to think this decompressor was delivering incorrect output, but you were concerned with what was being done _next_ with the data being decompressed, then you’d want to find out not ‘what bytes are output, and how can I change that?’, but ‘when a byte is output, where does it go next, and is it the right place, and how do I reroute it to somewhere else?’.

For _this_ purpose, coroutines often make things less clear, rather than more. That’s especially true if they’re based on my C preprocessor system, because a person coming fresh to a function in that style is going to see some weirdo `crReturn` macro, look up the definition, be further baffled (it’s fairly confusing if you don’t already recognise the trick), and probably conclude that I’m throwing obstacles in their path on purpose! But other less ad-hoc coroutine systems have the same property; for example, in C++20 coroutines, the mechanism for dealing with yielded data values lives in a ‘promise class’ type, which is inferred from the type signature of the coroutine itself by a system of template specialisations that could be almost anywhere in the source file or any of its header files. If there isn’t clear documentation somewhere in your code base, it might be legitimately quite hard to find out what happens to data after it leaves a C++20 coroutine; you might very well find that the simplest way to answer the question was to step through the yield in a debugger and see what happened next.

Which of these kinds of clarity is more important? Of course, both of them _are_ important, because both are things you might need to understand, or fix, or update in your code. But if you spend 90% of time working on the code in one of those ways, and 10% of your time in the other way, you’re going to prefer the kind of clarity that helps you 90% of the time over the kind that helps you 10% of the time.

And it so happens that my own preference skews towards the first kind. Perhaps that has to do with the types of program I work on. All my life I’ve gravitated to programs that solve complicated problems, because that’s the kind of thing I enjoy doing. In those programs, the individual subproblems are complicated and so are the pieces of code that deal with them; the data flow between them is a small part of the overall system. So I don’t want to make debugging each sub-piece of code harder, just for the sake of making the data flow more explicit. I’d rather each piece made sense on its own terms at the expense of the data flow being a little more opaque.

This is also one example of a more general question. Is it better for each program to effectively define its own local customised variant of the language it’s written in (via very elaborate support libraries, metaprogramming tricks like macros, and the like), so that the learning curve takes a long time to climb, but you can work really effectively once you’ve climbed it? Or is it better to avoid diverging too much from the standard ways to use a language, so that a new programmer can get up to speed quickly?

Again, my preference skews toward the former. I value the ability to make my own life easier if I’m spending a long time in a code base. And I don’t much mind climbing the learning curves for other people’s differently customised coding environments, because I often learn something in the process (and maybe steal any good ideas I find). But I know that there are other people who are much more in favour of sticking to the orthodoxy.

(However, that’s only an argument against coroutines as long as they _aren’t_ the orthodoxy. With more mainstream adoption, perhaps this argument is weakening. Generators in Python are _definitely_ mainstream now: I’ve occasionally had a code reviewer tell me to use them _more!_)

Techniques for getting the most out of coroutines {#technique}
-------------------------------------------------

Of course, another reason why one person might find a language feature more useful than someone else is that they’re better at using it: better at spotting cases where it’s useful, better at getting the most out of it when they do use it. And let’s not forget the skill of _avoiding_ using it when it _isn’t_ useful, so that you don’t get annoyed by situations where it’s not really a good fit.

Here’s a collection of my thoughts on when and how to use coroutines for best effect.

### When to use coroutines, and when not to {#when}

My first general piece of advice is: _don’t be all-or-nothing about it_. Coroutines are useful in many situations, but they’re not the best tool for _every_ job.

Programming language features are conveniences, not moral imperatives. They exist to make your life easier. So in a case where a feature _doesn’t_ make your life easier, it’s OK not to use it.

(As far as I’m concerned, this applies to any language feature, not just coroutines. Another good example is recursion: it’s a very powerful and useful technique, but I have no time for languages that force you to use it for _everything_, even simple looping constructions. Especially if they also require you to learn all the tricks of passing extra parameters to permit tail recursion: to my way of thinking, that’s a clear sign that you’re trying to turn something into recursion that doesn’t really _want_ to be written that way. Similarly, not everything needs to be a class – sorry, Java – and not everything needs to be immutable – sorry, Haskell. Multi-paradigm is the One True Way, because it’s the only way that doesn’t insist that there’s a One True Way!)

As I said in an earlier section, precisely one of the good things about coroutines is that they give you the freedom to structure each part of a program in the way that’s most useful, independently of the rest. In particular, that includes the freedom to _not_ use a coroutine in a particular situation, if you don’t want to!

Coroutines are useful when successive calls to a function need to behave differently, in a way that ‘looks like control flow’. That’s hard to define, but after a while, you know the kind of thing when you see it: if the full sequence of function calls wants to exhibit a number of different behaviours one after another, or repeat an action lots of times with different actions coming before and after it, or diverge into two totally different sequences of operations based on some input condition (especially if you then re-converge into some later behaviour that looks the same regardless), or most especially repeat a sequence of things that _also_ include sub-repetitions and conditionals of their own. Those are all the kinds of thing that would be very natural to write using sequential code, or loops, or if-statements, or nestings of those things – so once you recognise that ‘control flow nature’, consider writing it as _actual_ control flow, in a coroutine.

On the other hand, some things just _don’t need_ to be coroutines. If a function needs to do basically the same thing every time, you _could_ write it as a coroutine anyway, containing nothing but an infinite ‘while true: do thing’ loop, but there wouldn’t be any real point. That’s just boilerplate that makes simple code more complicated for the sake of it. In that situation, don’t bother!

### Types of code that might usefully become coroutines {#use-cases}

Just waving my hands and saying ‘spot things that look like control flow’ isn’t the most helpful advice in the world, of course! So in this next section I’ll mention some things I’ve found them useful for in the past.

In coming up with the list, I found it convenient to categorise coroutines according to whether they yield to get inputs or to produce output or both, and to what other pieces of code.

#### Output only: generators {#generator}

One of the simplest kinds of coroutine, and perhaps the most familiar to at least Python programmers,<sup id='footnote-python-coroutines'>2</sup> is the kind that yields values to a consumer, but its input comes either from the parameters it was passed on creation, or from ordinary function calls.

(Of course, those function calls might be to the ‘next’ method of other generators, in which case you can look at this as taking input from a different coroutine after all! But only semantically: in a [later section](#resumable-callee) I’ll mention a performance concern relating to this.)

If a coroutine only generates output, then there’s a third alternative to making it a coroutine (as well as the state-machine and thread options discussed earlier): you can simply make it compute _all_ its output ahead of time, and return it in full as a list or array. This gives you all the same advantages in terms of writing the control flow in a natural and readable style. For example, here are two versions of a simple function that finds the ‘record-breaking’ values in a list, i.e. every value that is larger than all the ones before it:

```
\# Written as a generator
def record_breaking_values(inputs):
    it = iter(inputs)
    best = next(it)
    yield best
    for value in it:
        if value > best:
            best = value
            yield best
```

```
\# Ordinary function that just returns a list
def record_breaking_values(inputs):
    it = iter(inputs)
    best = next(it)
    records = [best]
    for value in it:
        if value > best:
            best = value
            records.append(best)
    return records
```

In that example, the ‘just return a list’ function is one line longer because of the actual `return` statement. But that’s a trivial concern. (And I could have made it a line shorter instead, if I’d eliminated the `best` variable and just checked `records[-1]`, but then the two pieces of code wouldn’t have matched so clearly.) The point is that the control flow inside the function is exactly the same, and the algorithm is equally clear to a reader, and equally easy to modify.

The advantages of the coroutine version over this are space and time. The space advantage is obvious: if that returned list is _long_, then it’s nicer to avoid ever having to store all of it in memory at once, and instead, throw away each value after it’s been used. This doesn’t reduce flexibility, because (at least in Python) there’s a very concise idiom for turning the output of a generator back into a list at the call site if you really do need it all available at once.

(Of course, this is exactly the same reason that Unix provides a system for piping data between processes, in place of the more obvious approach of writing the data to an intermediate temporary file. One way to look at coroutines is that they’re the in-process analogue of a Unix pipe!<sup id='footnote-knuth'>3</sup>)

The time advantages are more subtle. In fact it’s not immediately obvious how there’s a time advantage at all: surely the same _calculations_ have to happen, whether we select the record-breaking values in advance of using them or interleaved with using them.

And, of course, that’s true. If we really are going to use _all_ the returned data, then the _overall_ time taken to do the calculations is the same.

But sometimes we’re concerned with intermediate timings as well as the overall time. For example, if an interactive program needs to output the next value in a sequence when the user performs a UI action, then it’s nicer if the time taken to compute that value is reasonably bounded, rather than the program _occasionally_ saying “Hold on, I need to precompute the next 10000 items before I can give you the first of them…”

And sometimes we’re _not_ intending to use all of the returned data. Another way to look at generator-style coroutines like this is that they’re a form of _lazy evaluation_: no value in the logical output list is computed until another part of the program actually needs it, and that means that if _nothing_ ever needs the value, we never wasted the time of computing it. In the interactive scenario, you’d be _particularly_ annoyed at the program wasting your time on precomputing the next 10000 output values if you were intending to look at the first ten and then quit the program!

One special case of this, where you _really can’t_ compute the entire intermediate list up front, is if the intermediate list is potentially infinite! Some natural generators will just keep on and on generating data, and the only way to _ever_ stop them is by their consumer getting bored and discarding them.

In any case, the takeaway from this is: any time you see a function that constructs and returns a list, if it functions in more or less ‘append only’ mode (that is, it builds the list up from start to finish, and doesn’t have to refer back to an unlimited number of the existing items to decide what to append next), it’s worth considering whether it would be clearer written as a generator-style coroutine instead, if your language makes it convenient.

#### Input only: consumers {#consumer}

If I’ve had a section for output-only coroutines, then obviously I need a section for input-only ones.

At least in normal languages where a coroutine is a special kind of function, these don’t often seem to be very useful. It’s commonplace to have one piece of code producing data and passing it to another that consumes it, but you usually only need _one_ of them to be a special coroutine- or generator-type function; the other can just be a normal non-coroutine-style function that invokes the producer coroutine when it needs another item, e.g. by calling `next()` on a Python generator.

You generally _can_ write the two pieces of code the other way round, so that the producer is an ordinary function and the consumer is a coroutine. But it doesn’t often seem to be the easiest way to do things.

Partly, that’s because languages don’t make it quite as easy. In Python, for example, you _can_ pass data to a generator by calling `g.send(value)` and retrieve it inside the routine as the return value of the `yield` operator; but it’s awkward that the generator starts off in a state where its code hasn’t run at all yet, so you have to faff with it to get it to the point of first input. But other systems don’t have this awkwardness, or at least, you can arrange not to have it; for example, C++20 coroutines allow you to configure whether your coroutine should start off suspended, or run to the point of first yield / await. (Or other options.)

More importantly, the consumer end of the data pipeline is probably the one that’s taking the program’s main action. So you probably want to make _sure_ it completes. I mentioned above that one of the virtues of coroutines is often that they’re safely discardable (via the language’s cleanup or destructor system) if you want to abandon the computation half way through – but that stops being a virtue if the computation in question is the one you want to be sure of _not_ accidentally abandoning!

So I think it generally makes sense to have the producer end of the system be an easily discardable coroutine, and the consumer end be ‘normal’ code. That way, if the producer encounters an exceptional condition and can’t carry on producing data (e.g. a file it was reading from ended abruptly, or contained invalid data), the consumer can catch the exception and ensure it does something sensible, like switching to a fallback strategy, or deleting its half-written output file, or at the very least producing a useful error message. You probably don’t want it to be silently discarded.

#### Separate input and output: adapters {#adapter}

Once you’ve connected a producer to a consumer, the next natural step is to have something in the middle be both at once, consuming values from one side and emitting them to the other side.

The `record_breaking_values()` example I showed in Python earlier is already an example of one of those, depending on how you look at it. If you pass it a static thing like a list, then it’s just a producer coroutine, doing computation based on its original parameters; but if you pass it another generator as an argument, then it ‘yields’ to that generator by calling `next()` on it, and yields to its consumer by using the actual `yield` statement.

There are lots of natural adapters of this kind that you might usefully write as coroutines. Again, it’s not _always_ the right thing to write them that way, but it can very easily be.

For example, here’s a tiny Python generator function that I put in a lot of my programs, because I often find I want to use it, and despite being so simple, it’s not in the standard library:

```
def cyclic_pairs(inputs):
    it = iter(inputs)
    prev = first = next(it)
    for curr in it:
        yield prev, curr
        prev = curr
    yield prev, first
```

Given a list of inputs such as _a_,_b_,_c_,_d_,_e_, this returns each pair of adjacent list elements as a tuple, so that you get (_a_,_b_), (_b_,_c_), (_c_,_d_) and (_d_,_e_) as outputs.<sup id='footnote-pairwise'>4</sup> Finally, it produces the pair that ‘wraps round the end’, consisting of the last element and the first, in this case (_e_,_a_).

If you knew the input was in the form of an already-complete list, you could write this easily enough by iterating over the list indices, and returning `(list[i], list[(i+1) % len(list)])`. But if you write it in this form then it can take any iterable as input – including another generator, which perhaps doesn’t even know what all its output is going to be yet.

What makes this a natural use case for generators? It’s the special cases at the start and the end.<sup id='footnote-StopIteration'>5</sup> If every input value was treated exactly the same, then you could just as easily write this as a tiny class storing the `prev` variable, with a `__call__` method that constructed each tuple and updated `prev`. But in reality, the _first_ element from the input iterator must be treated specially (in that we still put it into `prev` but don’t yield a tuple at all), and when we reach the end, we have an extra thing to do (namely yielding that final wraparound tuple). You _could_ fake that up in your class, perhaps by special-casing `prev=None` (but what if the input iterator contained some legitimate `None` values itself?), or more likely by a system of flag variables in the class. But then you’re in ‘explicit state machine when you didn’t really want one’ territory – so it’s easier just to write code like this, which says directly, in sequence, what things you want to do, in what order.

Adapters like this fit nicely into the ‘Unix pipeline’ model, as I described a couple of sections earlier. So they’re still only a performance improvement, in space and maybe time, over doing things the pedestrian way with intermediate lists.

#### Input and output talking to the same entity: protocols {#protocol}

Now we come to the case where coroutines deliver more than a performance optimisation: where they do both input and output, but the output goes to the _same entity_ that’s providing the input.

It doesn’t exactly matter what that entity _is_: it might be another part of the same program, or it might be a human interacting with the program, or it might be another program at the far end of a network connection. But if the entity at the other end has to see your outputs so far before deciding what your next input is, and you have to do the same to generate _your_ next output, then this type of coroutine _can’t_ be rewritten as a function that just generates the whole output list up front.

One of Knuth’s examples in TAOCP was a piece of code that implements a chess-playing algorithm. That’s exactly a case of this kind: each time you output a move, you have to wait to find out what my responding move is before you can even decide what moves you can _legally_ play next, let alone which one is best. You can imagine a function like this talking to a human player through some user interface code – but you could also set two copies of it playing against each other, yielding control flow back and forth each time one of them made a move.

(On the other hand, I don’t know that chess is a good case for coroutine style, because as far as I know, chess algorithms these days work by analysing whatever board position they’re given, and if they retain any state from the previous move it will only be in the form of cached evaluations of potential future game states. So a ‘next chess move’ function probably wouldn’t want to be a coroutine after all. But some games’ rules – or optimal strategies – _do_ go through sequential phases that would suggest a coroutine-structured playing function.)

But gaming is a frivolous use of this idea. A much more practical one is network protocols. The reason coroutines occur throughout PuTTY is because they’re so useful for implementing sequential network protocols, under the constraint that the top level of your program is an event loop waiting for whatever input event happens next out of network connections, user input, and sometimes timers.

A good example is the key exchange layer of the SSH protocol. The two sides exchange setup packets that list all the different cryptographic algorithms they’re prepared to use; out of those options, they select the best one that both sides understand, and then exchange several packets to perform a key exchange according to that algorithm. Having done that, each side installs a new set of cryptographic keys, and then exchange encrypted packets implementing the actual interactive login session – until one side decides it’s time to refresh the cryptography, and sends another key-exchange setup packet.

The sequence of packets within each key exchange method is different; only one of those sequences is used; and the whole thing takes place in a loop, restarting every time a new key exchange is needed. These are all markers of ‘looks like control flow’, and make it very natural to write the code in a style like this:

```
function key_exchange() {
    send(KEXINIT); // key exchange initialisation packet
    wait for other side’s KEXINIT;
    outer loop {
        decide what key exchange type we’re doing;
        if (it’s this type) {
            send this;
            expect that;
            send some response;
        } else if (it’s some other type) {
            expect the other side to send a packet first;
            send a totally different response packet;
        } else {
            // potentially more and more cases like this
        }
        install new keys;
        inner loop {
            get next packet from server;
            if (it’s KEXINIT) {
                // time to do another key exchange
                send our own KEXINIT;
                break from inner loop; // so we return to top of outer loop
            } else {
                pass the packet on to the next layer up;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This function is structured as if it’s calling a subroutine to retrieve the next packet from the other side of the connection. But in reality, it’s going to _be_ called each time a packet arrives – so we have to either make it a coroutine, or turn it inside out by setting up an explicit state machine. I think keeping the code in this nice sequential form is _far_ preferable, so coroutines it is!

In fact, this kind of pattern recurs throughout SSH. The ‘packets’ that are arriving in the code shown above are built up from the actual stream of bytes coming from the network by means of reading an initial few bytes giving the packet length, then reading that many more bytes to get the rest of the packet, then reading the authentication code at the end (if any); doing all the decryption and integrity checking, and finally, having a packet available to output. This code too wants to be written in a style where it calls a ‘wait for _n_ more bytes of network data’ function – but, again, it’s _being_ called from the main event loop when data comes in on the network socket. So that layer too is a coroutine, in the simpler ‘adapter’ style where the input and output are separate: it consumes bytes from the event loop, and periodically yields a completed packet to the key-exchange layer shown above.

And the ‘next layer up’ – mentioned at the end of the above pseudocode – does all of this _again_. Initially, it’s the user-authentication layer of SSH, which might prompt for a password, or use a public key, or do something more complicated still; any of those might fail, in which case it has to loop back round and try the next fallback approach. So that’s very natural to write as a coroutine as well. The whole structure of SSH is almost _designed_ to be three coroutines stacked on top of each other!

(Once you’ve actually logged in, things get a bit less coroutiney. The ‘connection layer’ that takes care of running shell sessions is much less sequential. In PuTTY, it’s still structured as a coroutine, but _mostly_ that coroutine sits in an endless while loop just responding to each packet as it comes in. That would normally be the kind of boring stateless code that it’s not really worth making into a coroutine at all – except that right at the start we have to do a few setup tasks like opening an initial session channel, so the coroutine consists of a small amount of sequential setup code and _then_ the boring while loop.)

This isn’t an article about SSH alone, of course. That’s just a particularly good example. Many other network protocols are just as sequential. For example, PuTTY’s code to connect via an HTTP proxy is also structured as a coroutine.

In fact, that code has an extra wrinkle too. Sometimes, when authentication fails in HTTP, you can try again within the same network connection; but sometimes you have to close the connection to the HTTP server and open a fresh one. So there’s not just a sequence of operations _within_ a network connection: there’s also a sequence of _connections_ involved. In PuTTY, this is all handled with a single HTTP proxy coroutine: sometimes it yields a special return value to its caller saying ‘please close the connection, open a fresh one, and call me back when that one’s ready’. Then it can go back round to the top of its loop and continue trying to authenticate.

#### More general, and miscellaneous {#uc-general}

In all of the previous subsections, I’ve shown coroutines with at most one input channel and at most one output. Of course, you can also have more than one of each.

There are two conceptually different ways that a coroutine might consume two input streams. One is that it yields to a _specific_ input stream each time it wants a new value, so that it’s in control of how fast the two input streams deliver data. There are lots of examples of this in purely computational contexts: consider, for example, a function that merges two sorted lists, or zips together two or more streams by making a tuple of one element from each stream, or other things of the kind you might find in Python `itertools`.

The other approach, more suited to coroutines that are doing asynchronous I/O, is that the coroutine might yield in such a way that it will be resumed when _any_ of the input streams has data available – no matter which one it is. For example, some of PuTTY’s SSH coroutines have to handle both network data and user input: the user authentication coroutine will sometime respond to a network packet by presenting a password prompt to the user, and then it has to receive the password that the user typed in return and construct the network reply packet. But there’s no guarantee of which is going to happen next, out of a network packet arriving and the user pressing a key. So the coroutine is resumed whenever _either_ one happens.

That style of coroutine is tricky to write well, and I have some advice about it in later sections. Here, I just mention that it’s among the possibilities.

Another slightly unexpected ‘stunt’ use of coroutines is to use them to reconstruct the call-stack structure of ordinary subroutines: replace every normal function call with a coroutine-style yield operation which makes a newly constructed instance of the subroutine start running next, and whenever a coroutine terminates, resume the one that invoked it.

Why on earth is _that_ a useful thing to do, you might ask? If we want something that behaves like an ordinary function call stack, doesn’t the typical programming language have one built in already?

I’ve found that useful in the past as a means of working around limitations of the true function call stack. In Python, for example, you can only nest function calls about 1000 deep, and I’ve sometimes needed to recurse much more deeply than that – e.g. running graph algorithms over a DAG with very long chains, such as a git repository. It’s surprisingly convenient to rewrite function calls and returns in a style like this…

```
\# Before
def routine(x):
    i = subroutine(x+1)
    j = subroutine(x*i)
    return i+j
```

```
\# After
def routine(x):
    i = yield Call(subroutine(x+1))
    j = yield Call(subroutine(x*i))
    yield Return(i+j)
```

… and then have a small piece of ‘executor’ code which maintains a stack of currently active generators in an array, and contains a loop which always resumes the innermost generator on the stack. If that yields a `Call` object containing another generator, push that one on the stack, so that it will be the one resumed next; if it yields a `Return` containing a return value, pop the stack, and pass the value to the new topmost generator when it’s resumed.

When I’ve done this in the past, my reason has always been to get round Python’s recursion depth limit. But I can think of other reasons for reifying your stack into explicit data objects.

One reason is so that those objects can be saved and restored. Given the right language support, you might be able to tweak a system like this to allow the entire state of a half-finished recursive computation to be written out to a disk file; then the program could be terminated, and when run again later, reload the file and carry on from where it left off. (Although you would also need a method of saving the _internal_ state of each coroutine, which might be harder.)

Another is that once you replace the language’s built-in control flow with your own imitation, it becomes easy to extend or modify it. You could imagine adding a third kind of data object alongside `Call` and `Return` which had a different effect on the executor. For example, you might have two or more call stacks and switch between them, implementing ‘co-threads’ (which I’ll talk about more in [a later section](#cothreads)).

In fact, perhaps you might decide that keeping the active function calls in an array was itself a limitation you wanted to go beyond. Not all languages insist on a linear stack in that way. Scheme, for example, has multiple control-flow features (continuations and `dynamic-wind`) with the effect that the stack is replaced by a general DAG of function activations, and several branches of the DAG can be resumable. (This also means that the stack frames must be subject to garbage collection.) A technique like this could be used to implement continuations in languages that don’t have them natively!

Speaking of messing about with control flow, another stunt use of coroutines – in the right context – is to invent your own control flow _statements_, alongside standard things like ‘for’, ‘while’ and ‘if’.

Some languages encourage you to invent control flow primitives of your own, by means of making it easy to pass blocks of code to a function call:

```
function my_control_structure(code) {
    set up stuff;
    while (some condition)
        code.run();
    clean up stuff;
}

# now the braced block becomes the ‘code’ parameter to the above function
my_control_structure {
    statements;
}
```

The _wrong_ way to implement this language feature is to literally wrap up the code block at the call site into a lambda function, and have the control-structure function execute the block using a normal function call. The problem with this is that then the code blocks don’t really run in the context of the containing function. They might be able to access the function’s local variables, by virtue of lexically scoped lambda capture, but the control flow is isolated. If one of those blocks executes a ‘return’ statement, then it only returns from the _block_, not the containing function (as it would if you executed the same return inside, say, a while loop). And if you want to ‘break’ from a loop implemented by these means, then executing the ‘break’ statement inside the lambda doesn’t work at all. This all makes your artificial control structure look ‘second class’ compared to the language’s built-in ones.

Instead of doing that, the _right_ way – and some languages actually do this, such as Ruby – is for the control-structure function to be a coroutine. Instead of its code blocks being ordinary functions that it calls in the ordinary way, they should remain in the context of the original function, and the control structure should _yield_ back to the original function, telling it which block to run next. Then custom control structures would be just as good as the standard ones, and wouldn’t behave surprisingly differently in edge cases.<sup id='footnote-if-for-while'>6</sup>

Of course, if you’re not using a language that already works this way, then finding a way to implement it can be tricky or impossible. But once I just about found a way to do it in C, combining my [preprocessor coroutine system](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html) with [another preprocessor trick](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/mp/) for making custom control structures at all. In C++ you might do it more easily by having the macro at the call site expand to a range-`for` loop. It will depend on the language.

### Coroutines large and small {#large-and-small}

That ‘control flow nature’ that makes a piece of code a natural fit for coroutines can occur at all scales, from the largest to the smallest.

Among the examples in previous sections, I’ve already shown examples at both ends of that spectrum. Some of the largest and most complicated parts of PuTTY’s SSH code, such as the key exchange or the user authentication protocol layers, are implemented as a giant coroutine. On the other hand, that tiny `cyclic_pairs` Python generator is not far off being the smallest possible piece of coroutine-shaped code that’s worth bothering to write.

It’s also worth considering various ways to slice up, or break down, the problem. In SSH the multiple protocol layers lend themselves nicely to being a coroutine _each_; they’d be much more unwieldy implemented as one single one. On the other hand, for some network protocols, a single coroutine might be suitable for running the entire network connection.

And in some other situations, you might have a variable number of coroutines, with each one tracking the progress of a single transaction _within_ a network protocol. I have an example of that too in the PuTTY code: the SSH agent, Pageant, is mostly a non-coroutine loop that answers queries in whatever order they arrive – but whenever a client of the agent requests a signature from one of Pageant’s private keys, it spawns a small coroutine to handle the progress of _that specific signing request_, because sometimes it will need to prompt the user for a passphrase, loop round again if that didn’t work, be prepared to abandon the attempt if the user clicks Cancel, etc. This is all control-flow-shaped code – but it suited the problem best to have a coroutine for _each_ signature request, not one for the whole connection.

So, when you’re on the lookout for coroutine-shaped parts of a program, don’t forget to look for the large ones, the small ones, and everything in between!

#### Activation energy {#activation-energy}

Of course, depending on the language, that might not be good advice after all.

In Python, writing a generator is made extremely easy. It’s no harder than an ordinary function; you just write `yield` at least once in the body, and everything is taken care of for you. So there’s no reason I _shouldn’t_ write things like that `cyclic_pairs()` function as a generator, if it’s only a tiny bit clearer. There’s essentially no cost. The next five lines of my code would look a bit nicer as a generator? Fine, dash off a generator, why not?

But if you were writing in C++20, there’s a much higher barrier to entry. C++20 coroutines are [very expensive](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/coroutines-c++20/) to set up – not so much in runtime cost (though I’m sure there is _some_), but in programming effort. You have to write a whole ‘promise class’ with lots of methods explaining how the coroutine should behave in this or that circumstance. If the only actual coroutine you wanted to write was going to save you (say) five lines of code, then writing a whole C++20 promise class from scratch wouldn’t be a net win, because it would cost you a hundred or so lines to set up the necessary infrastructure. You have to _really want_ coroutines to bother setting them up in a C++20 program.

However, C++20 does let you reuse the promise class for multiple coroutines that want to work in similar ways. So if you had _twenty_ five-line snippets you wanted to write that way, it might become worth it. But if you’d already written the first 19 in ordinary non-coroutine style, then when you got to the break-even point, it might _still_ not seem worth your while to go to the effort of writing the promise class _and_ converting all the existing cases to use it…

(Also, this is only a temporary complaint about C++. C++23 will bring `std::generator`, which should make this kind of simple job _actually_ simple again.)

### Combine with input queues {#queues}

In TAOCP’s presentation of coroutines, and many others, the whole point is that you yield to the other piece of code precisely when you have data to transfer. If a producer is constructing a stream of objects and sending them to a consumer, then you write the producer as if it has a function it can call for ‘here, I have this object for you’, and you write the consumer as if it has a function for ‘ok, what’s my next object?’, and there’s exactly one pair of transfers of control for each object that traverses the boundary.

But sometimes that’s not the best way to do it. When it’s not, don’t do it that way!

One case where it’s awkward is the [case I mentioned previously](#uc-general) of having a coroutine that can receive more than one type of input, and doesn’t know which one will come next. For example, PuTTY’s SSH authentication layer used to implement password / passphrase prompts itself, so it received a stream of events in which SSH packets and user keystrokes were interleaved, and any call to the main userauth coroutine might be providing _either_ of those kinds of event.

But if you’re writing code in a coroutine-structured style, then in a lot of cases, you know which input type _you_ want to see next – and it’s very annoying to have to put a handler for the other one after each yield. For example, if you’re _not_ in the middle of presenting a password prompt to the user, what do you do with a keystroke when you receive one? Conversely, if you’re waiting for the user to finish typing a password, and another network packet comes in, what do you do?

In those early versions of PuTTY, I mostly ignored the problem. While the userauth coroutine was waiting for network packets, if it was called with a keystroke, it would simply discard it – drop it on the floor.

An effect of that was that you couldn’t open a PuTTY window and immediately start typing the first shell command you wanted to run in your session, _even_ if you knew that authentication was going to succeed without needing any prompts (say, because you were using an SSH agent). You’d expect to be able to ‘type ahead’, and have your keystrokes buffered until the main shell session was ready to use them. Instead, for as long as authentication hadn’t finished yet, they’d just be thrown away.

After a while, that became annoying. I wanted keystrokes to _never_ be dropped. But I also wanted to write my userauth coroutine in the most convenient way. What to do?

Instead of passing SSH packets or keystrokes directly to the userauth coroutine, I made two _queues_ in the SSH layer, to hold SSH packets and user input respectively. So when the lower layer had a packet to deliver to the userauth layer, it wouldn’t pass the packet directly to the userauth function; instead, it would put the packet on the userauth layer’s incoming packet queue, and then call the userauth function with no arguments, just saying ‘hello, it’s worth waking up and checking your queues’. And the same went for user input.

This solved my problem. Now, when userauth knows the next thing it’s expecting is an SSH packet, it can run a little resume loop that says ‘Is there a packet waiting in my queue? If not, suspend, and look again when we’re resumed.’ If user input arrives in the meantime, it goes on the _other_ queue, and will still be there when the userauth layer gets to a different place in the code where it needs some user input – or perhaps it won’t be consumed by userauth at all, and will be picked up by the connection layer (the one that runs shell sessions after you log in), so that you _can_ type ahead into the shell prompt you expect to see later.

In particular, sometimes the userauth layer wouldn’t need to suspend itself at all. It would look at its queue and discover there was _already_ something there, and charge straight on without ever having to yield.

(In C, using preprocessor coroutines, this little loop was the easiest way to wait for a particular one of the possible input events. If I were rewriting this code using the C++20 coroutine system, I could formalise it, by defining a specific `co_await` idiom for ‘now I want to wait until there’s something in this queue’. That could be set up so that it would avoid resuming the coroutine _at all_ until that queue stopped being empty – and it could also automate the initial check of ‘maybe we don’t even need to suspend at all because we already have a packet waiting’.)

Another case where queues are useful is if the data objects are very small and numerous. For example, if you wanted to write a coroutine that received a stream of _bytes_ from another part of the program – say, because the producer was a file decompressor, or the consumer was a file compressor – then it would be bad for performance to require two coroutine-transfer overheads per individual byte. Instead, the producer would prefer to provide as many bytes in one go as it conveniently can (especially since it might have read lots of them in a block from a file, or a decompressor might have generated a lot at a time from a run-length record or an LZ77 copy). But then the consumer might not need exactly that many for _its_ next operation. So it would make sense to append bytes to a queue (probably in the form of a circular buffer, or chain of small buffers, or something else space-efficient per element). The producer could generate as much data as was convenient (or would fit in the buffer), and then yield at the point when producing the next byte would need actual effort; then the consumer could eat as much of the queue as possible, and yield back when it wanted more bytes than were available.

But, just like I’ve been saying about everything else in this article, don’t take it to extremes. Using an input queue or buffer isn’t _always_ the right thing. One of the effects of representing a stream of data as a coroutine is that the stream is lazily evaluated: no element is computed until it’s really needed. So if some or all of the data values are _expensive_ to compute, then either don’t use an intermediate queue at all, or else make sure you never put more than one thing in the queue _unless they’re easy_.

(`spigot` is a good example of this problem. The coroutines in that are mostly generators that yield streams of integer matrices. For some generators, the matrices are uniform and simple; for others, an occasional matrix is _exceptionally_ costly to compute. So in that application, queues didn’t seem worth the effort; yielding exactly once per matrix is the simplest way to be absolutely sure that we never even start trying to compute a matrix until its consumer knows it’s needed.)

### Combine with ambient pre-filters {#handlers}

Here’s one more trick on the theme of ‘only use coroutines for the coroutine-shaped parts’.

Sometimes, a stream of data contains things that have to be handled sequentially, _interleaved_ with things that should be handled the same at any time.

An example of this is the key-exchange ‘transport layer’ of SSH. This includes all the packet types I mentioned [earlier](#adapter) (the `KEXINIT` start packet, various sequences of packets to perform different key exchanges, and a `NEWKEYS` message to signal that you’re about to switch to the newly generated encryption keys); but it _also_ includes a small number of messages that can arrive at any time and must be handled correctly when they do.

The handling isn’t always _difficult_. One key example is the `IGNORE` message, which either side may send at any time, and the other side – as suggested by the name – must ignore it. That’s the single easiest possible way to handle a packet.

But now suppose you’ve written your transport layer in the form of a coroutine. There will be lots of separate points in the code where you yield, wait for the next packet, and expect it to be of a particular type (typically, whatever comes next in the key exchange you’re performing). Now _every one_ of those yield points has to have an extra check for the `IGNORE` message, which loops round to get the packet after it:

```
// What you’d like to write
function transport_layer() {
    // ...
    pktin = co_await PacketInputQueue;
    if (pktin.type != FOO)
        disconnect("got packet type %s, wanted FOO");
    // ...
}
```

```
// What you have to write instead every time
function transport_layer() {
    // ...
    while (true) {
        pktin = co_await PacketInputQueue;
        if (pktin.type == IGNORE)
            continue;
    }
    if (pktin.type != FOO)
        disconnect("got packet type %s, wanted FOO");
    // ...
}
```

If you’ve got even ten or twenty yield points in your coroutine, this is a lot of tedious boilerplate code – and worse, a lot of places to accidentally leave out that extra clause, and introduce a latent bug that will only show up when a server actually _does_ happen to send `IGNORE` in that particular context. And it only gets worse when you have to support the rest of SSH’s any-time message types. Ignoring that `IGNORE` message _isn’t_ the easiest thing in the world, it turns out!

So don’t do it that way.

Instead, a structure I’ve found useful is to have a ‘pre-filter’ on the queue, which isn’t part of the coroutine at all. Whenever new packets arrive on the queue, they’re seen first by the pre-filtering code. That will handle things that can arrive at any time, like `IGNORE` and its friends. The only remaining packets are the ones that _are_ expected to appear in a sensible sequence that’s natural to write as a coroutine. And _those_ are passed to the main transport-layer coroutine, which can handle them in the natural way, without having to do anything at a yield point that isn’t related to what that _particular_ yield point is trying to achieve.

So this lets the coroutine handle only the coroutine-shaped parts of the protocol: the things that happen in sequences, or conditionally, or in loops, and look like control flow. Meanwhile, the awkward things that can interrupt your nice orderly control flow are simply removed from the coroutine’s view of the input and handled by a central dispatch function. Then each style of code can do what it does best; or, looking at it the other way round, each part of the problem can be solved in the way that’s most natural for that part.

(_How_ do you wedge this pre-filter system into a world organised by coroutines? PuTTY uses C preprocessor coroutines, in which there’s a convenient slot within the coroutine function itself – just before the `crBegin` macro – where you can put code that will run on every single resume, before control is transferred to wherever the function last suspended. For languages which implement coroutines natively, that slot probably doesn’t exist, so you’ll have to do it the more pedestrian way of hiding the coroutine resume operation behind a separate wrapper function, and having that wrapper do any pre-filtering necessary before resuming the actual coroutine.)

The SSH packets I’ve been talking about here are fixed. They can be sent at any time at all in the protocol, and they _never_ want to be handled by the coroutine code. But in other situations, there are message types which you _sometimes_ want to handle in the sequential coroutine code, even though at other times you’d rather they were handled by the pre-filter so that the sequential code can concentrate on something else.

In this situation, you can still keep the sequential code in the coroutine and the any-time handlers in the nicely separate filter function, by means of the coroutine setting variables that affect how much the filter function filters. Then the coroutine can dynamically control what subset of the inputs it sees, and always focus its attention on the ones that behave sequentially.

Those variables can be as simple or as complicated as you like. It might be as simple as having a single boolean flag saying whether the coroutine would currently like to see whatever kind of thing is only sometimes interesting to it. Or you might need some kind of set variable saying which types of thing you currently care about. Or maybe the filter might need to be a complicated lambda function, who knows. It will depend on how much control you need to have over the filter.

One idea along these lines that I haven’t yet had the opportunity to try is to have a _lexically scoped_ handler, installed for the duration of a particular block of code, and uninstalled again automatically by an object’s destructor. It might look something like this (details completely made up):

```
function event_stream_consuming_coroutine() {
    // Here, we can receive any event type
    event = co_await EventQueue;

    {
        // Install a handler for a particular event we don’t want
        // to be bothered with in the next loop
        HandlerInstaller hi(EventQueue, EVENT_BORING, lambda(event) {
            fixed code to handle this event;
        });

        // Now do some kind of a loop over the remaining event
        // types, which can assume EVENT_BORING never appears.
        while (some condition) {
            // imagine lots of subsidiary control flow here
            event = co_await EventQueue;
        }

        // At the end of this block, the HandlerInstaller object
        // goes out of scope, and its handler is uninstalled
    }

    // And here we’re back to being able to receive any event,
    // even EVENT_BORING
    event = co_await EventQueue;
}
```

The idea is that the `HandlerInstaller` class has a constructor which arranges to add the specified event type to the pre-filtering system sitting in front of this coroutine. In this example, I’ve also shown it taking a lambda function as an argument, so that we can say _what_ to do with one of those `EVENT_BORING` events if it happens within this block.

Then, when the `HandlerInstaller` goes out of scope at the end of the block, its destructor runs, and uninstalls the handler again. So after the block ends, `EVENT_BORING` is no longer being filtered out of the coroutine’s input, and the final `co_await` could receive one.

I haven’t had a chance to experiment with this style yet, because you can’t do it with preprocessor coroutines. (Not even in C++, where you do have destructors. Preprocessor coroutines in C++ require all the coroutine’s persistent variables to be members of its containing class, so they can’t be scoped to sub-blocks of a function.) But you could do it in C++20’s native coroutines, where you get to declare block-local variables in a natural way. So when I write my first real system based on C++20 coroutines, I might give it a try!

Coroutine paradigms {#features}
-------------------

Finally, in this last section, I’ll talk about some different ways to _think_ about coroutines, in the sense of what kind of thing they even are.

I’ve mentioned a couple of things of that kind in passing, in previous sections: I said that coroutines can be seen as the in-process analogue of a Unix pipe, or as the imperative-programming analogue of lazy evaluation (particularly something like Haskell’s lazy lists). But those were more about the kind of _tasks_ you can use them for; the next few sections will be more about what they _are_ than what you can use them as.

### TAOCP’s coroutines: symmetric, utterly stackless {#taocp}

Knuth’s presentation of coroutines in The Art of Computer Programming calls them a ‘generalisation’ of subroutines. That characterisation doesn’t make sense in all contexts, but in that particular context, it does.

In TAOCP, all the example programs are written in machine code for the fictitious MIX architecture. MIX is strange by modern standards – entire generations of CPU architecture fashion have come and gone _between_ MIX and the more-or-less RISC architectures of today.

In particular, MIX has no real commitment to the existence of a _stack_. Typical CPU architectures of today consider a stack to be a fundamental necessity: there’s a special register reserved for use as the stack pointer, which it’s either impossible to use for any other purpose, or at least highly inadvisable. Too much of the design is based on the assumption that _of course_ you’ll want a stack.

But in MIX, nobody is making you use a stack. And Knuth, in many cases, doesn’t. His example MIX programs are generally set up so that each function has just one copy of its variables, stored at fixed addresses – and when one function calls another, the return address is just another of those variables.

This way of organising code works fine for every purpose except recursion (and multithreading): if a function’s variables always live at the same address, it follows that you can’t have two independent instances of the function active at once. So a function may never call itself, either directly or through any other chain of intermediate functions. Or rather: if you _do_ need a particular function to have multiple concurrent activations, you’ll have to make a special effort to enable it to do so – for example, by manually implementing a stack inside that function.

(It’s surprising to the modern eye how little emphasis TAOCP puts on recursion, in fact! Current treatments of programming tend to consider it to be one of the most fundamental and important techniques, to be taught early and used often. By contrast, Knuth clearly _knows_ about it, but is able to get a startling amount done without having to resort to it.)

Anyway. The relevance of all this to coroutines is:

The MIX subroutine call instruction works like most RISC call instructions: rather than pushing the return address on to a stack in memory, it simply writes it into a particular register called rJ, and then it’s up to the callee to decide what to do with it. So a normal MIX function call works by the caller doing one of these jumps, and then the callee saves the rJ register in one of its own memory locations,<sup id='footnote-self-modifying-code'>7</sup> so that it can remember where to jump back to at the end of its task.

The MIX call instruction is also its normal jump instruction. (rJ isn’t used for anything else, so that’s generally safe.) So the callee uses the same instruction when it returns, to transfer back to the caller. The only difference is that the caller jumps to the _start_ of the callee, whereas the callee saves the rJ register on entry and jumps to wherever it said. On return, the caller _also_ receives a value in rJ, because that jump instruction updated it too – but it ignores it, because it doesn’t care which particular place in the callee control came back from.

And that’s the sense in which coroutines ‘generalise’ subroutines. With subroutines, each side receives a value in rJ, but only one of them bothers to remember it. With coroutines written in MIX in this style, the only difference is that _both_ sides remember the value they receive in rJ, and _both_ sides use it as the place to transfer control to next.

So, unlike most languages’ built-in coroutines (and certainly unlike my C preprocessor approach), this setup is completely symmetric. There is no sense in which one of the two functions ‘really is’ the caller, and the other one is just ‘pretending to be’ the caller using a special kind of yield statement. Each one is doing exactly the same thing as the other. They are _co_\-routines, in the sense of “equal partners”.

### A subroutine that can resume from where it last left off {#resumable-callee}

Of course, in modern CPU architectures, there _is_ a stack. And in almost all high-level languages (by which, in this case, I mean ‘any higher than assembly’ – even COBOL counts), there will be a function call and return system that assumes a stack, and each function will store its local variables on the stack. So if we want to have functions interoperating in a coroutine style, and each of those functions occupies a region of memory on the call stack, then one function is going to _have_ to be higher up the stack than the other.

This introduces an ugly asymmetry into the perfectly symmetric system Knuth described. We have to make an arbitrary decision about which way up to order the two functions on the stack, and whichever way round we make the decision, you might reasonably ask “Why wouldn’t it be just as good to do it the other way?”

But it has to be done, so we make a choice, and designate one of our formerly equal coroutines as the ‘caller’ and one as the ‘callee’. What are the consequences?

An invariant of the conventional stack-based function call system is that the currently executing function must be the deepest one on the stack. You just aren’t allowed to have extra stuff occupying stack space below<sup id='footnote-stack-grows-downwards'>8</sup> the frame of the current function. (One reason is that asynchronous things like signal handlers or interrupts might overwrite that space without warning.)

So, when the caller is executing, _the callee can’t have a stack frame at all_. There would be nowhere for it to live.

Therefore, when the caller transfers control to the callee, the callee has to _construct_ a stack frame. And when control transfers back the other way, that stack frame has to be thrown away again. So the physical view of what’s happening on the stack looks exactly like the caller making multiple independent calls to some subroutine: each time, a new stack frame is created, lives briefly, and is destroyed again.

The only differences between this and an ordinary subroutine is that the callee coroutine has to preserve all its variables between calls – which means they have to be stored somewhere _other_ than on the stack – and that every time it’s ‘called’, it has to resume from just after wherever it last returned from.

This is the compromise that most languages’ coroutine systems end up settling on. My C preprocessor coroutine system is exactly this: a coroutine-structured function contains a macro at the start that can arrange to transfer control to any of the yield points in the function, and at each of those yield points, a variable is updated to mark that point as the one to resume from next time, and then the yield macro executes the ordinary C `return` statement. So the function’s physical stack frame is destroyed (which is OK because all the important state is kept in a `struct` elsewhere), and on the next call, a fresh stack frame is created.

The same is true of C++20 coroutines; it’s better hidden, but the low-level code generation will be doing basically this if you look deep enough. I expect the same is true of other languages that compile to ordinary stack-based native code.

This ‘resumable subroutine’ architecture has consequences beyond the details of the low-level implementation. Here are two:

Firstly, what happens if you want to divide up the work of the callee coroutine into subroutines? (For example, in Python, a generator can `yield from` another generator, so that the second one runs to completion and delivers all its results to the same place as the first generator.) The most obvious way to implement a ‘sub-coroutine’ is to have the parent coroutine call it repeatedly in a loop, passing its results back one by one:

```
function parent_coroutine() {
    yield START;

    // Make an instance of a sub-coroutine
    coroutine_instance sub = sub_coroutine();
    // And run it to completion, passing on all its yields
    while (sub is not finished)
        yield sub.next_yielded_thing();

    yield END;
}
```

Now if even the _parent_ coroutine is having its stack frame demolished completely on every yield, then the same thing must be happening to the sub-coroutine. So if we nest sub-coroutine ‘calls’ _n_ layers deep, then every time the innermost one yields and resumes, the implementation will have to tear down _n_ stack frames and set them all up again. _The resumable-subroutine model makes deeply nested sub-coroutines expensive in performance._

There might be a way to get round this, one way or another. For example, in C++20 coroutines, you can [set up a promise class](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/coroutines-c++20/#stacked-generators) in such a way that the logical ‘stack’ of sub-coroutines never occupies the physical stack all at once: instead, at each stage, a physical stack frame is only needed for the _currently executing_ coroutine in the logical stack. But it’s not necessarily the _default_ way that things will work, so it’s something you have to keep in mind and watch out for: if there’s a special way to avoid this stack usage problem, remember to do it if your nesting gets too deep, and if there isn’t one, don’t _let_ your nesting get too deep.

Secondly, if your language supports exceptions, what happens if a coroutine throws one?

Exceptions propagate up the physical stack. So if the callee coroutine throws an exception, it can propagate out into the caller. (For example, an exception in a Python generator propagates out into the function that called `next()` on it.) But if the caller throws an exception, it can’t propagate in the reverse direction.

It may be possible to configure this to some extent. C++20 coroutine systems let you explicitly control what happens to an exception thrown in the coroutine. But you still can’t propagate an exception from ‘normal’ code _into_ a coroutine by any sensible method.

So, if you care about exceptions, perhaps that might drive your choice of which of those two ‘equal’ coroutines to turn into the caller, and which the callee: in which direction (if any) would you like exceptions to travel between the two? Whichever direction that is, it might be easiest to make that ‘up the stack’.

(And if, in some extra-confusing scenario, you want exceptions to be able to travel in _both_ directions – maybe based on the type of the exception – then you _really_ have a challenge on your hands. Good luck, and have fun.)

### Cooperative threads that identify which thread to transfer to next {#cothreads}

I performed a minor sleight of hand in the previous section. Did you spot it?

I said: if we want two functions to interoperate in coroutine style, and each one occupies a region of the stack, then one function has to be higher up the stack than the other.

But hang on. “The” stack? _Who said there was only one?_

This is the 2020s, and we’ve met multithreading by now. So we’re already used to the idea that a complicated program might contain _multiple_ stacks, in widely separated regions of memory. We could put our two interoperating coroutines on _separate_ stacks.

This immediately solves the problem of sub-coroutines. Now each coroutine is free to be reorganised into as many subroutines as it likes, without impacting performance by having to forward values up and down a long chain, or having to constantly destroy and rebuild physical stack frames. Either stack can yield to the other, no matter how deep it’s currently nested; when it does, execution resumes in the other stack from wherever it left off, by restoring the _stack pointer_ as well as the location within the current function.

Working in this style, it becomes natural for sub-coroutines to have a ‘return value’, separate from whatever data they yielded. (For example, C++20 has `co_return`, separate from `co_yield`.) Just as an ordinary function performing I/O can return a value to its caller indicating success or failure, or returning the result of its I/O operation, a sub-coroutine that you call to yield on your behalf can return a value to you, perhaps communicating the same kind of thing.

Having two stacks restores the elegant symmetry of MIX’s coroutines: once again, our two (or more) stacks are equal partners in the program’s overall endeavour, with neither one being forced to take an artificially subordinate role.

But this is also what I meant when I said earlier that Knuth’s account of coroutines as ‘a generalisation of subroutines’ didn’t make sense in all contexts. In _this_ model, coroutines and subroutines aren’t more and less general versions of the same concept: they’re _independent_ concepts, and you have both of them at once. I like to imagine them at right angles to each other: coroutine transfers go left or right between stacks, whereas subroutine calls or returns go up and down within a stack.

OK. So: if each of our coroutines comes with its own stack, then doesn’t that make them a lot like threads? What’s the difference?

Firstly, these coroutine stacks are _cooperative_. Control only transfers between them when they ask for it on purpose. This makes them unlike ordinary threads, which are pre-emptively switched by the OS kernel, or (better still, if possible) actually run simultaneously on more than one CPU of your multi-core computer.

This cooperative nature makes it easy to avoid the synchronisation problems of real threads. You don’t need to take out a lock to stop another coroutine stack from accessing the same data as you: all you have to do is _not yield to it_ while you’re in the middle of a critical section, and then it’s guaranteed not to be running at the time.

Cooperative multithreading isn’t totally unheard of even in normal OS contexts. In the late 1980s, for example, RISC OS came out, which was a GUI operating system that let you run multiple programs at once, but it was cooperatively multithreaded:<sup id='footnote-riscos'>9</sup> your program would continue running without interruption until you called the ‘wait for a GUI event’ system service, and only then would the OS switch to running another process. And until _that_ process made the same system call, _you’d_ never get control back.

But when you did that, you didn’t know which other program would run next. It wasn’t really your business to know: the other programs were independent of you. If you exchanged data with another program at all, it would be mediated through the OS, perhaps via drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste, and you might not care _what_ other program it was, only that it was providing data you had to do something with.

But in a coroutine-organised program, the data flow between the coroutines is highly structured, and the whole point. If you’re a coroutine stack acting as an adapter in between a producer and a consumer, then you most certainly do care which stack runs next: the consumer mustn’t run until you have a data item ready for it, and the producer mustn’t run until you’ve disposed of the one you’re holding.

That’s the other vital difference. Coroutine stacks get to _identify which stack to switch to next._ That adapter thread doesn’t just ‘yield to whoever has something to do’: it has two fundamentally different operations, ‘yield to the producer’ and ‘yield to the consumer’.

So, that’s my third model of what kind of thing coroutines can be. They’re like cooperative threads, except that switching between them is done in a manner like a coroutine yield rather than like a system call: the yielding ‘thread’ chooses which ‘thread’ is going to run next, and maybe passes it a data object of some kind, which it might need in order to resume running at all.

I’ve been talking about the CPU’s physical call stack structure throughout this section, but now I’ll contradict myself by saying that, at the physical low level, depending on the language implementation, the ‘stack’ of each of these ‘threads’ need not _actually_ look anything like a physical call stack.

You _could_ make it look like one. You could allocate a piece of memory for a coroutine stack; let the coroutines on it push and pop stack frames like ordinary function calls; and have a special ‘yield’ function that swaps out the stack pointer and switches over to executing on another stack. In fact, that’s not a bad way to add coroutines to a language that doesn’t already have them, because it doesn’t need the compiler to have any special knowledge of what’s going on. You could add coroutines to C in this way if you wanted to, and the approach would have several advantages over my preprocessor system. (Though also some disadvantages: this way, you have to anticipate every CPU architecture your code will need to run on, and write and test the low-level stack setup and switching code for all of them. Also, you lose the advantage I’m about to talk about in the _next_ section.)

But it’s just as likely that a language’s implementation of coroutines will choose to do it another way. For example, in C++20, you can certainly arrange for coroutines to be able to call each other as subroutines, but the natural way to set it up involves the logical ‘stack’ of those calls being an array or a linked list inside the coroutines’ promise objects. A separate physical call stack is never allocated, and (as I mentioned in the previous section) a call frame on the existing physical stack is only allocated for the currently running coroutine.

I’ll end this section on an extra-confusing note: if the coroutine stacks are kept in a format completely separate from the physical call stack of a thread, that opens the possibility of combining stacks of coroutines _with_ conventional threads – so that when a coroutine stack has some work it can do, it could be resumed on the call stack of any thread that was free!

### A named object identifying a program activity {#named-object}

Finally, I want to go back to a point I touched on in [a previous section](#vs-threads).

While I was comparing coroutines to ordinary threads (pre-emptive or genuinely concurrent), I mentioned that it’s useful that a suspended coroutine is always in a state where it can be conveniently destructed, if the computation or data stream or activity it’s producing is no longer needed.

More generally, once you’ve started a coroutine and it’s suspended itself, there will typically be some kind of _object_ in the programming language that represents its state. That object will behave like any other: you can assign it (or maybe a pointer to it) into a named variable, and you can store that variable wherever you like. You could have other objects contain pointers to activities they care about; you could keep all your activities in an array; you could store each one in a separate variable with an easy-to-remember name.

If your language supports automatically destructing things when they go out of scope, this lets you tie the lifetime of the coroutine to some other lifetime you already cared about. For example, if a particular other class is consuming the coroutine’s output, you can keep the coroutine object inside that class, and then you _just don’t need to worry_ about clearing it up: the coroutine will automatically be thrown away exactly when nothing can possibly need its output any more, even if it was only half-finished. And if it had any internal variables that also needed cleaning up, that will all happen automatically too, because the language should arrange that _their_ destructors run. In a language using RAII, even external resources like open files should be cleaned up with no fuss.

(If your language _doesn’t_ support automatic destruction, you still get an echo of this usefulness. For example, if you’re using my preprocessor coroutine system in C, then each coroutine already has to have a structure type storing all its internal state. If you want to be able to abandon an unfinished coroutine, then you have to accompany the coroutine with a hand-written function that frees that state structure and any subsidiary resources its fields point to. But in C, you’re accustomed to writing those functions all the time anyway, so coroutines are no different – and if a non-coroutine object of some kind owns a coroutine state, then the free function for the first object will naturally call the free function for the coroutine state. And _vice versa_. So it’s still natural to set up your code so that coroutines are cleanly destroyed; C makes you do all the _work_ yourself, but it’s easy to _organise_ it sensibly. This is one of the reasons I mentioned in the previous section for why I still use preprocessor coroutines in C instead of low-level stack switching: it would be a much harder job to free an in-progress _physical call stack_ and all the resources allocated by unfinished calls on it!)

An interesting thing about this ‘conveniently destructible’ nature is that it wasn’t anywhere in TAOCP’s presentation of coroutines, and I presume therefore not in earlier work either. (That’s not _surprising_, of course, since languages with automatic destruction weren’t around in those days.) I only really thought about it that way myself when someone suggested to me the idea of combining coroutines with threads (as I mentioned at the end of the previous section), and wondered what the advantage might be over _just_ using threads. I decided this was it: if your in-progress activities are explicitly stored in a data structure separate from the threads that are executing them, then you can abandon an activity in an easier and cleaner way than destroying a thread. It’s always interesting when the most useful feature of a thing turns out to be one that its originator never thought of!

Anyway. This is my final way of looking at coroutines: they allow you to encapsulate a computation, or some other particular strand of your program’s activity (such as one among many network connections it’s handling), into an object which has a name in your programming language, and can be accessed from outside the coroutine.

If you’ve expanded each coroutine into a call stack of its own, as I discussed in the previous section, then this is still true: from outside the coroutine stack, you still have _one_ named object, which encapsulates the whole stack. For example, if the coroutine yields data values, then that object will be where the rest of the program goes to get them: it will have the `next()` method, or the C++ iterable semantics, or whatever the language finds convenient. Whichever layer of the coroutine’s internal call stack yields a value, the values will all be delivered out of that same single object, without anyone outside the coroutine stack having to know or care about the internal subdivisions. And destroying that object should clean up the entire stack, even if it had multiple layers of unfinished internal subroutine calls.

But having a named object identifying an activity is useful for more things than just destroying it. Objects can also provide other methods, or expose their internal data to the rest of the program on purpose.

For example, if you have a coroutine object that encapsulates the progress of some activity, you might arrange that it presents methods returning details of its progress – perhaps a headline figure like ‘85% complete’ for the graphical progress bar, or perhaps details of the last subdirectory it scanned, or what phase of a network connection it’s in. As usual, the advantage of doing this with coroutines rather than threads is that there’s no worry about concurrent access: if the coroutine is suspended, then you can safely read its data (or at least the data it’s publishing on purpose).

You might also arrange that methods on the wrapping object can _modify_ the progress of the coroutine in some way. That case is harder to think of good examples for, but they do sometimes come up.

One example of this comes up in an example I’ve already shown, from PuTTY. In [a previous section](#protocol) I showed pseudocode of the coroutine that handles the SSH transport layer, which periodically does key exchanges. A repeat key exchange can be triggered by either side sending the `KEXINIT` packet. In the pseudocode earlier I showed the coroutine responding to the _other_ end sending `KEXINIT`. But what if _we’re_ the side that decides it needs to rekey first?

Suppose we had a function `trigger_rekey()` that the rest of the program would call when it decided that needed to happen. That function could construct a `KEXINIT` packet and inject it into the output packet queue. When the other end responded with its own `KEXINIT`, the `key_exchange()` coroutine would resume, and see it. But then how would it know that in _this_ case it shouldn’t respond by sending one of its own? Answer: the `trigger_rekey()` function also wants to set a flag _in the coroutine’s state_ that says “We’ve already sent our `KEXINIT`, don’t send another one”. Then `key_exchange()` sees the incoming `KEXINIT` but also sees that the flag is set, so it goes back round to the top of the loop without sending an unwanted extra `KEXINIT` first. That’s the kind of thing that an accompanying mutator method on a coroutine might usefully do.

OK; what _else_ can you do with a data object in a programming language, as well as deleting it, reading its state, or changing its state?

Here’s a _really_ silly idea: you can _copy_ it. Suppose you _cloned_ a coroutine object, together with all of its internal state?

Using my C/C++ preprocessor coroutine system, this is perfectly possible. In that system, all the persistent variables of the coroutine – including the state variable that says where to resume from next – have to live in an explicitly declared structure (in C) or be members of a class (in C++). Either way, there’s no difficulty with making an exact copy: in C, you’d have to write a cloning function that dealt with memory allocation and deep copying, but that’s an easy mechanical job and the structure definition lists all the fields you need to handle. And in C++, you might very well be able to use the class’s default copy constructor and have it Just Work.

After you do that, you’ve got two copies of the coroutine, and each of them will resume from the _same_ part of the code when it next runs. It’s very like the Unix `fork` system call in that respect.

This isn’t a _deliberate_ feature of my preprocessor system; it’s just a thing that drops out naturally from the implementation strategy, and turns out to be easy to do. I doubt that any language-native coroutine system will be willing to do this stunt.

But if you _can_ do it, what might it be useful for?

One thing that springs to mind is testing, if your coroutine accepts input on each yield. Run the coroutine to a particular point, then repeatedly clone it and try lots of different inputs on independent copies of it, making sure that each one is handled correctly. This might be a lot less expensive that running from the start of the coroutine to the test point _again_ for each test input.

Another possibility is to use the same idea at run time, to probe the coroutine from outside and _find_ an input that will cause it to respond in a particular way. But I haven’t thought of a use for that at all!

Conclusion {#conclusion}
----------

I started writing this article because I wondered if I had anything in particular to say about coroutines. Turns out I had quite a lot!

Perhaps this will convince a few more people to become coroutine fans. Or perhaps it will give some existing coroutine users new ways of thinking about them and using them. Or perhaps not, and everyone reading this will decide I have weird opinions that they disagree with.

But it was fun to write, and helped me clarify my _own_ thoughts. And it’s my blog so I can be self-indulgent if I want to. Thanks for reading!

Footnotes {#footnotes}
---------

With any luck, you should be able to read the footnotes of this article in place, by clicking on the superscript footnote number or the corresponding numbered tab on the right side of the page.

But just in case the CSS didn’t do the right thing, here’s the text of all the footnotes again:

[1.](#footnote-win32-read-write) For example, in the Win32 API, if you have a bidirectional file handle such as a serial port or a named pipe, and you need to simultaneously try to read and write it, I think it really _is_ the least inconvenient thing to have two threads, one trying to read the handle and one trying to write it. The alternative `GetOverlappedResult` approach ended up being _more_ painful when I tried it.

[2.](#footnote-python-coroutines) I talk about generators as if they were _the_ coroutine system in Python, but in fact, they’re one of two: Python _also_ has a [completely different kind of thing](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#coroutines) that it actually uses the name ‘coroutine’ for, in which function definitions start with `async def` and suspend with `await`. I’ve never played with those, because generators are easier to get started with and have scratched my generalised coroutine itch well enough. But at some point I should at least give them a look.

[3.](#footnote-knuth) In TAOCP, one of Knuth’s suggestions for a producer/consumer chain is that you might be flexible enough to make a runtime decision as to _whether_ to run both parts interleaved as coroutines, or whether to run them sequentially storing the intermediate data on disk, depending on how much memory you have. I suspect this was a more vital concern in the 1970s.

[4.](#footnote-pairwise) The non-cyclic version of this is also useful. As of Python 3.10 that _is_ in the standard library, as `itertools.pairwise`, although I’m going to have to keep writing it by hand until I can rely on Python 3.10 or better being widespread enough. But as far as I know the cyclic version still isn’t in `itertools`.

[5.](#footnote-StopIteration) Incidentally, yes, I know, there’s another special case that my code doesn’t handle: if the input iterator has _no_ values, then the example version of `cyclic_pairs` shown here will raise `StopIteration`, when perhaps you’d prefer it to silently generate an empty output list. Before Python 3.7 this happened automatically, because `StopIteration` was handled differently; in many of my own use cases I never pass an empty list anyway. But if you were writing a version general enough to go in `itertools`, you’d probably want to check for that case properly.

[6.](#footnote-if-for-while) In my fantasy programming language, this would _actually_ be how the standard control structures were implemented. The only primitives in the language itself would be ‘goto’ and coroutines. _All_ block-structured control flow commands, even the standard things like ‘if’, ‘for’ and ‘while’, would be defined in the standard prelude as small coroutines of this kind, implemented in terms of ‘goto’. Then they wouldn’t need to be keywords!

[7.](#footnote-self-modifying-code) In fact, Knuth does this by self-modifying code. The memory location where you save the return address is actually the destination-address field _within the jump instruction_ that performs the return!

[8.](#footnote-stack-grows-downwards) For the sake of not using too many words, I’ll assume the most common convention for stack layout, which is that the stack grows downwards in memory: pushes make SP smaller, pops make it bigger, and when you call a subroutine, its stack frame is below yours. If you’re used to one of the rare architectures that does things the other way up, just turn your head upside down while reading this section.

[9.](#footnote-riscos) RISC OS is still around the last time I heard, and will run on a Raspberry Pi in particular. I have no idea if it’s _still_ cooperatively multithreaded, though. Wikipedia seems to say it is, but its most recent citation is from 2003…
